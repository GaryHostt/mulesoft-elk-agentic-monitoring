PROMPT TO SEND TO CLAUDE
------------------------
Call the get_service_logs tool with service_id my-service and time_lookback PT15M. What do you get?


EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
-----------------
- Claude invokes the MCP tool get_service_logs with arguments: { "service_id": "my-service", "time_lookback": "PT15M" }.

- If Elasticsearch is up and the index has data for service_name "my-service":
  The tool returns a JSON body with service, total_hits, log_summary, time_window. Claude should summarize that (e.g. "The tool returned … total_hits … log_summary …").

- If Elasticsearch is down or the app returns an error:
  The tool response will contain an error payload (e.g. {"error": "Elasticsearch unavailable", ...}). Claude should report that the tool returned an error and quote or summarize the message.


OPTIONAL SECOND PROMPT
----------------------
Call the check_anomaly_status tool with job_id my-ml-job. What's the result?

Expected: either anomaly JSON (if ML is enabled and the job exists) or an error from the app.
